# Spotify-Data-Analysis

# Spotify is the largest music streaming service available. Spotify has around 286 million users including 131 million paying subscribers. It is the ideal platform for artists to # reach their audiences across the world. In this project, we have intended to understand the evolution of music over time as well as to understand the characteristics of various # genres of music popular among the users. The main goal of this project is to ultimately provide recommendations of songs to users based on their preference, based on different  # features of the userâ€™s playlist.
